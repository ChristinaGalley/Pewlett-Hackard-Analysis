# **Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis**
---
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This report was written to summarizes the analysis and help prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
---
## Results
- A data table named retirement_titles was created to determine the employees eligible for retirement along with the range of dates they worked under each title. 
- Using the data from above, a unique_titles table was created to display the most recent title of each employee eligible for retirement.
- As shown in the retiring_titles data table below, % of retiring employees work in a senior role. This means there will be a large deficit in employees filling those senior job positions once the “silver tsunami” hits.

## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
