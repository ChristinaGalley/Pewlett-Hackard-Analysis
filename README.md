# **Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis**
---
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This report was written to summarizes the analysis and help prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
---
## Results
- A data table named retirement_titles was created to determine the employees eligible for retirement along with the range of dates they worked under each title. 
- Using the data from above, a unique_titles table was created to display the most recent title of each employee eligible for retirement.
- As shown in the retiring_titles data table below, 64% of employees eligible for retirement work in a senior role. This means there will be a large deficit in employees filling those senior job positions once the “silver tsunami” hits.

## Summary
A total of 90,397 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. There are 1550 qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. This leaves a ratio of about 1:58 regarding mentors to new employees who will be filling the roles of the retirees. 58 new employees may be a lot for one mentor depending on their teaching capacity and style. However, the mentorship program could be customized to support this capacity by dividing the new employees' training up by month in a 6 month period. This would mean each mentor would train about 10 new employees per month for a 6 month period as opossed to training 58 employees all at once. Two additional queries that may provide more insight into this mentorship plan inculde listing the number of returning vs new employees in each department and departement age oldest to youngest. This would allow the company to disperse and prioritize their mentors according to the capacity and experience level of each department throughout the 6 month period.
